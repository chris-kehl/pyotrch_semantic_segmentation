Semantic Segmentation with PyTorch

This ipynb is a simple pytorch semantic segmentation.
We use pytorch to experiment. This is my first experience
with semantic segmentation, more to follow.

MMSegformer_tutorial is a tutorial which implements MMSegformer on a new database. 
This is used to learn the file structures. I intend to use this tutorial on the RUGD
dataset.
